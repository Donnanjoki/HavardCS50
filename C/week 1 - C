### Intro

`` Machines only understand binary, this machine code is a pattern of ones and zeros that produces a desired effect.

`` Code can be evaluated upon three axes, which are
1]] correctness

## Loops - a forever loop

    while (true)
    {
        printf("meow\n");
    }

    any other non-zero number is interpreted by the computer as true

    hence the forever loop can also be written as;
    while (1)
    {
        printf("meow\n");
    }
