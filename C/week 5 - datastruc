## DATA STRUCTURES

---

> . Data structures are forms of organization in memory.
> . There are different ways to organize data in memory, such as abstract data structures which are those that we can conceptually imagine.

## Stacks and Queues

---

> . Queues are one form of abstract data structures.
> 1]] Queues have specific properties such as FIFO or first in first out
> 2]] They also have specific actions associated with them such as an item can be enqueued; that is the item can join the line or queue, and furthermore the item can be dequeued or leave the queue once it reaches the front of the line.

> . Queues contrast a stack both also in properties.
> 1]] They are LIFO or last in first out.
> 2]] They have specific actions associated with them, example "push" places something on top of a stack. "Pop" is removing something from the top of the stack.
