## Compiling ##

>. Encryption is the act of hiding plain text from prying eyes, while decryption is the
act of returning the encrypted piece of text back to human-readable form.

>. A compiler is a specialized computer program that converts source code into machine code, which can be understood by a computer.


## Debugging ##

>. A debugger is a software tool created by programmers to help track down bugs in code.


## Arrays ##

>. various data types require a certain amount of system resources:
1. bool 1 byte
2. int 4 bytes
3. long 8 bytes
4. float 4 bytes
5. double 8 bytes
6. char 1 byte
7. string ? byte

>. A string is simply an array of variable of type char: an array of characters.

## Command-Line Arguments ##

>. These are arguments that are passed to your program at the command line. 

## cryptography ##

>. This is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
>. plaintext and a key are provided to a cipher, resulting in ciphered text.
>. The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext.
>. The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.
