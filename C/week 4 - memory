## Valgrind

> . Valgrind is a tool that can check to see if there are memory-related issues with your programs wherein you utilized malloc. Specifically, it checks to see if you free all the memory you allocated.

## Garbage Values

> . When you ask the compiler for a block of memory, there is no guarantee that this memory will be empty.
> . Itâ€™s very possible that this memory that you allocated was previously utilized by the computer. Accordingly, you may see junk or garbage values. This is a result of you getting a block of memory but not initializing it.

### Overflow

> . A heap overflow is when you overflow the heap, touching areas of memory you are not supposed to.

> . A stack overflow is when too many functions are called, overflowing the amount of memory.

> . Both of these are considered buffer overflows.

## malloc

> . Memory allocation (malloc), is an in-built function in C. This function is used to assign a specified amount of memory for an array to be created. It also returns a pointer to the space allocated in memory using this function.
