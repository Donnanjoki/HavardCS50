### Flat-file Database

> . Data can be described in patterns of columns and tables.
> csv or comma-separated value files are files that are flat in that all the data is stored in a single table represented by a text file.
> This form of data is called flat-file database.

### Relational Database

> . SQL is the standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
> . SQL stands for structured Query Language 0 lets you access and manipulate data.
> . SQL can

### Using SQL in Your Web Site

To build a site that shows data from a database, you will need:
1] An RDBMS database program such as MS Access, SQL server, MYSQL
2] To use a server-side scripting language PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript (NodeJS)
3] To use SQL to get the data you want
4] To use HTML/ CSS to style the page

### Relational Database Management System - RDBMS

> . This is the basis for SQL and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft Access.
> . The data is RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

## SQL Statement

> . Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements. Most of these SQL statements consists of keywords that are easy to understand.

Note: SQL keywords are not case sensitive, hence select is the same as SELECT.

### Semicolon after SQL statements?

> . Some databases require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement
> . Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one sql statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

### Most Important SQL Commands

1] SELECT - extracts data from a database
2] UPDATE - updates data in a database
3] DELETE - deletes data from a database
4] INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
